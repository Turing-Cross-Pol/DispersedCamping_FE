# DispersedCamping
A mobile app that allows users to post dispersed campsites theyâ€™ve found.  The goal is to build an app with a social presence that allows users to find, submit and vote on dispersed campsites. The app would allow them to add details about the camp site, how far off a main road is it, whether it requires 4-wheel drive, size, upload photos, etc.  Users would be able to upvote/downvote posts by other users.
